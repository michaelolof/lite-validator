# Installation

Installation is as straightforward as any Vue plugin.

First install module as a dependency.

```bash
$ npm install --save vue-state-validator
```

In your main.js file install as a plugin.
```js
// main.js

import Vue from "vue";
import VueStateValidator from "vue-state-validator";

Vue.use(VueStateValidator);

```

That's it!. Now, you're good to go.
